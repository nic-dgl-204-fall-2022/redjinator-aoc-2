# Redjinator Advent of Code (2 of 3)

[Day 5 - Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/5)

## Overview of problem
For this problem we have a large list of strings in a text file and we want to evaluate each one to find out how many of them meet the critera to be on Santa's the nice list:
    1. Must contain 3 vowels
    2. Must contain at least one letter that appears twice in a row. (ex: 'xx')
    3. Must NOT contain the strings: "ab", "cd", "pq", "xy". Even if they are part of another requirement.

The text file is 1000 rows in length made up of strings that are 16 characters in length.

Sample of `input.txt`
```
zgsnvdmlfuplrubt
vlhagaovgqjmgvwq
ffumlmqwfcsyqpss
zztdcqzqddaazdjp
eavfzjajkjesnlsb
```

### Obstacles
* Get strings from file and convert to a list.
* Functions to check for each of the 3 criteria required to make the nice list .
* Iterate through the list and evaluate each string
* Keep a count of the total strings that make the nice list.

### First Solution

#### part1() function
As per normal the part1() function will be the intended implementation of our solution which will return an Int variable representing the total number of strings that meet all 3 of our pre-determined critera for the nice list. The list of measurements in the file input.txt is obtained using readInput() found in Utils.kt and passed as an argument to part1().
```
fun main() {
    fun part1(input: List<String>): Int {

        // Extension functions to check for each of the criteria
        fun String.hasUnwantedStrings() = this.zipWithNext().any { it.first == 'a' && it.second == 'b' } ||
                this.zipWithNext().any { it.first == 'c' && it.second == 'd' } ||
                this.zipWithNext().any { it.first == 'p' && it.second == 'q' } ||
                this.zipWithNext().any { it.first == 'x' && it.second == 'y' }

        fun String.hasVowels()      = this.count { it in "aeiou" } >= 3
        fun String.hasLetterTwice() = this.zipWithNext().any { it.first == it.second }

        // Checks string eligibility for nice list
        fun isNice(str: String): Boolean {
            return !str.hasUnwantedStrings() && str.hasVowels() && str.hasLetterTwice()
        }

        var totalNiceList = 0

        for(string in input) {
            when(isNice(string)) {
                true -> totalNiceList++
                false -> continue
            }
        }

        return totalNiceList
    }
    
    val input = readInput("input")
    println(part1(input))
}
```
### Obstacle #1
I used the `readInput()` function from the `Utils.kt` to get the list of strings from file and then pass it as an argument to the function `part1(input)`.

### Obstacle #2
I used String extension functions for each condition/criteria, it was much simpler to write out the required functions due to the ease of referencing the strings using `this` and `it`.

`String.hasUnwantedStrings()` Makes use of the function `this.zipWithNext()` returns a list of pairs which are referenced using `it.first` and `it.second` for comparrison with the unwanted string types. When it is called it uses the ! not operator, so if there are no unwanted strings present the function returns true. 

`String.hasVowels()` Iterates through the string, checking each character against the sample string of vowels provided. If vowels found are greater or equal to 3 it returns true.

`String.hasLetterTwice()` Similiar to `String.hasUnwantedStrings()` the difference being that `it.first` and `it.second` are  checked for equal

### Obstacles #3 & #4
`isNice(str: String): Boolean` function takes a string as argument and checks for the pre-determined criteria using the extension functions returning true if the string made the nice list and false if it does not.

I used a for loop to iterate through the input list and a when condition to increase the `totalNiceList` if a string `isNice()` and finally the part1() will return the total number on the nice list. `return totalNiceList`. 
```
var totalNiceList = 0

for(string in input) {
    when(isNice(string)) {
        true -> totalNiceList++
        false -> continue
    }
}
```
